Changes in Version 1.0.7

     * Catch KeyError in pycassa.columnfamily.ColumnFamily.multiget() empty row
       removal. If the same non-existent key was passed multiple times, a
       KeyError was raised when trying to remove it from the OrderedDictionary
       after the first removal. The KeyError is caught and ignored now.
     * Handle connection failures during retries. When a connection fails, it
       tries to create a new connection to replace itself. Exceptions during
       this process were not properly handled; they are now handled and count
       towards the retry count for the current operation.
     * Close connection when a MaximumRetryException is raised. Normally a
       connection is closed when an operation it is performing fails, but this
       was not happening for the final failure that triggers the
       MaximumRetryException.

Changes in Version 1.0.6

    * Add EOFError to the list of exceptions that cause a connection swap and
      retry
    * Improved autopacking efficiency for AsciiType, UTF8Type, and BytesType
    * Preserve sub-second timestamp precision in datetime arguments for
      insertion or slice bounds where a TimeUUID is expected. Previously,
      precision below a second was lost.
    * In a MaximumRetryException‘s message, include details about the last
      Exception that caused the MaximumRetryException to be raised
    * pycassa.pool.ConnectionPool.status() now always reports a non-negative
      overflow; 0 is now used when there is not currently any overflow
    * Created pycassa.types.Long as a replacement for pycassa.types.Int64.
      Long uses big-endian encoding, which is compatible with Cassandra’s LongType,
      while Int64 used little-endian encoding.

Changes in Version 1.0.5

    * Assume port 9160 if only a hostname is given
    * Remove super_column param from pycassa.columnfamily.ColumnFamily.get_indexed_slices()
    * Enable failover on functions that previously lacked it
    * Increase base backoff time to 0.01 seconds
    * Add a timeout parameter to pycassa.system_manager.SystemManger
    * Return timestamp on single-column inserts

    * Added pycassa.system_manager.SystemManager.describe_snitch()

    * Renamed pycassa.system_manager.SystemManager.get_keyspace_description()
      to pycassa.system_manager.SystemManager.get_keyspace_column_families()
      and deprecated the previous name
    * Moved pycassa.system_manager.SystemManager.describe_keyspace() and
      pycassa.system_manager.SystemManager.describe_column_family() to
      pycassaShell describe_keyspace() and describe_column_family()

      provided by a Connection class.
    * Updated pycassaShell to use the SystemManager class
    * Improved retry behavior, including exponential backoff and proper resetting
      of the retry attempt counter

    * Use more performant Thrift API methods for insert() and get() where possible
    * Bundled OrderedDict and set it as the default dictionary class for column families
    * Provide better TypeError feedback when columns are the wrong type
    * Use Thrift API 19.4.0

Changes in Version 0.5.4

    * Allow for more backward and forward compatibility
    * Mark a server as being down more quickly in Connection

      automatically with a ColumnFamily.

Changes in Version 0.5.2

    * Support for adding/updating/dropping Keyspaces and CFs in pycassa.connection.Connection
    * get_range() optimization and more configurable batch size
    * batch get_indexed_slices() similar to get_range()
    * Reorganized pycassa logging
    * More efficient packing of data types
    * Fix error condition that results in infinite recursion

    * Use Thrift API 19.3.0

Changes in Version 0.5.1

    * Automatically detect if a column family is a standard column family or a super column family

    * pycassaShell documentation
    * Use Thrift API 17.1.0

Changes in Version 0.5.0

    * Don’t attempt to reencode already encoded UTF8 strings

Changes in Version 0.4.1

    * Added batch_insert()
    * Redifined insert() in terms of batch_insert()
