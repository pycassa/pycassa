Changes in Version 1.0.2

    * Failover handles a greater set of potential failures
    * pycassaShell now loads/reloads pycassa.columnfamily.ColumnFamily instances when the underlying column family is created or updated
    * Added an option to pycassaShell to run a script after startup

    * Changed pycassa.connection.connect() to return a connection pool
    * Use more performant Thrift API methods for insert() and get() where possible
    * Bundled OrderedDict and set it as the default dictionary class for column families
    * Provide better TypeError feedback when columns are the wrong type
    * Use Thrift API 19.4.0

Changes in Version 0.5.4

    * Allow for more backward and forward compatibility
    * Mark a server as being down more quickly in Connection

      automatically with a ColumnFamily.

Changes in Version 0.5.2

    * Support for adding/updating/dropping Keyspaces and CFs in pycassa.connection.Connection
    * get_range() optimization and more configurable batch size
    * batch get_indexed_slices() similar to get_range()
    * Reorganized pycassa logging
    * More efficient packing of data types
    * Fix error condition that results in infinite recursion
    * Limit pooling retries to only appropriate exceptions
    * Use Thrift API 19.3.0

Changes in Version 0.5.1

    * Automatically detect if a column family is a standard column family or a super column family
    * multiget_count() support
    * Allow preservation of key order in multiget() if an ordered dictionary is used
    * Convert timestamps to v1 UUIDs where appropriate
    * pycassaShell documentation
    * Use Thrift API 17.1.0

Changes in Version 0.5.0

    * Connection Pooling support: pycassa.pool
    * Started moving logging to pycassa.logger
    * Use Thrift API 14.0.0

Changes in Version 0.4.3

    * Autopack on CF’s default_validation_class
    * Use Thrift API 13.0.0

Changes in Version 0.4.2

    * Added batch mutations interface: pycassa.batch
    * Made bundled thrift-gen code a subpackage of pycassa
    * Don’t attempt to reencode already encoded UTF8 strings

Changes in Version 0.4.1

    * Added batch_insert()
    * Redifined insert() in terms of batch_insert()
    * Fixed UTF8 autopacking
    * Convert datetime slice args to uuids when appropriate
    * Changed how thrift-gen code is bundled
    * Assert that the major version of the thrift API is the same on the client
      and on the server
    * Use Thrift API 12.0.0

Changes in Version 0.4.0

    * Added pycassaShell, a simple interactive shell
    * Converted the test config from xml to yaml
    * fixed overflow error on get_count()
    * Only insert columns which exist in the model object
    * Make ColumnFamilyMap not ignore the ColumnFamily’s dict_class
    * Specify keyspace as argument to connect()
    * Add support for framed transport and default to using it
    * Added autopacking for column names and values
    * Added support for secondary indexes with get_indexed_slices() and
      pycassa.index
    * Added truncate()
    * Use Thrift API 11.0.0
